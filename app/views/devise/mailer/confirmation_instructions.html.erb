        <p>
          Welcome to the GiveLoco community. You're awesome and we are excited to have you on
          board.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we start, we'll just need you to <%= link_to 'confirm your account', confirmation_url(@resource, confirmation_token: @token, only_path: false) %> to ensure that you are not a robot.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you received this email by mistake, simply delete it. You won't be signed-up if you don't click
          the confirmation link above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once that's done, see how you can start using GiveLoco by visiting our How it Works page, get
          familiar with our community atmosphere by reading about our team, our goals and visions on our
          blog.
